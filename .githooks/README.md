=========
This directory contains `git` hook scripts that will be associated with this
clone of the repository by the toplevel `Makefile`'s `init` target.

The `pre-commit` hook is used to write a randomly generated value into a
dedicated file before each commit. This makes the particular commit easy to
find, without having to know its commit ID. `version.rkt` will look something
like this:

```scheme
#lang racket/base

(provide *stag-version*)

(define *stag-version*
  "The blue massive red whale electrocutes the marginal spiritual black consternation while the pen kisses the brisk second chipper cabinet.")
```

Before each commit, this file is overwritten to contain a new randomly
generated `*stag-version*`. The likelihood that the value for two different
commits will be the same is very remote.

The `*stag-version*` is included in any code generated by stag, along with
the command line arguments and schema withi which stag was invoked, so that
code generation is repoducible.
