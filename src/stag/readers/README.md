=======
This module provides the `include/string` macro, which takes a path to a
file and expands to a string containing the contents of that file.

This is used to include python code verbatim in the output of the code
generator (currently for the "private" python module), and to print this
source respository's [README.md](../../../README.md) file from the command
line.
